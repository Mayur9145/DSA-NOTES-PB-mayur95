# We are taking two pointers 
# We are starting one pointer from the first and one from the last
# We are beginning a while loop and wherever we get a matching with the value we are swapping
# We are swapping the matching value with the 2nd pointer which we assigned in the last
# Also we are incrementing i
# At the end we are returning the i value which will give us the answer
