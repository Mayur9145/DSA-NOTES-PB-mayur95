Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted leetcode problem
Approach- using two pointers , one at the beginning and one at the end then finding which sums up to the target 
and according to that updating both the pointers until we get the target


class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
         i=0,j=n-1,sum=0
        for i and j in range(n):
            target=list[i]+list[j]
              if sum==target:
                return i+1,j+1
                elif sum >target:
                    j--
                else i++
